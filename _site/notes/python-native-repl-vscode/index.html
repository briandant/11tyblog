<h1>just found the python native REPL in VS Code</h1>
<p>From the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/run">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Python interpreter that is installed on your machine gives you what's known as an interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which reads a piece of code, evaluates it, and then prints the result to the console.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's basically like using the Jupyter Notebook feature in VS Code, but with less overheadâ€”you don't need to create a notebook.  Looks sweet.</p>
