<h1>running make and tox targets in VS Code, under nix</h1>
<p>I've been a bit skiddish about running processes in the VS Code terminal.  Generally, the VS Code default mode does too much: auto-loading the venv, grabbing env vars from <code>.env</code>, and so on.  And I find myself with excess terminals that I forget to clean up well.</p>
<p>One of the weird things is that there was an env var being set each time a new terminal was opened, and I couldn't easily understand why.  I never really figured it out.  I'd kill VS Code, and the next instance would have the env var there.  I'm sure I could figure out why with some work, but I just defaulted to running things in iTerm, for the most part.</p>
<p>But I want to give it more effort.  Today, I'm now trying to run my <code>make</code> and <code>tox</code> targets in VS Code.  This way I can simply open the tasks pallete, run the task, and get on with my work while, e.g., the test suite runs.  Simple VS Code tasks to do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;tasks&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;tox -e py3&quot;,
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nix develop --command sh -c tox -e py3&quot;,
        },
        {
            &quot;label&quot;: &quot;make&quot;,
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,
            &quot;command&quot;: &quot;nix develop --command sh -c make&quot;,
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>We use <code>nix flakes</code>, but I wasn't sure about setting the nix environment before the task runs.  I think there's a plugin, but I didn't want to mess with it.  Though, having all shells default to a nix-shell would be good, and maybe there's a way to do that, so flakes doesn't have to do all it's check before each task.</p>
