# just found the python native REPL in VS Code

From the [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/run):

> The Python interpreter that is installed on your machine gives you what's known as an interactive REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which reads a piece of code, evaluates it, and then prints the result to the console.

It's basically like using the Jupyter Notebook feature in VS Code, but with less overheadâ€”you don't need to create a notebook.  Looks sweet.
