From my supervisor:

> The central problem with such discussions about AI, however, is the simple fact that Artificial Intelligence does not exist. There is an essential misunderstanding of human intelligence that undergirds all of these concerns and questions—a misunderstanding not of degree but of kind, for no machine is or ever will be “intelligent.”
